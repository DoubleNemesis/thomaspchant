            <TextBlock>
            I’ve been building websites as a hobby or professionally for almost 20 years using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, NextJS and WordPress.
            </TextBlock>
            <TextBlock>
            I’ve helped many organisations and companies reach wider audiences and increase client interaction, including The Devon and Exeter Institution, Exeter Historic Buildings Trust and Exeter English Online.

            Alongside my web development skills I have a Masters’ Degree in Creative Writing and have experience as a content creator both online and offline.

            <TextBlock>
            I’m happy to trouble-shoot small issues with design, responsiveness (how a website displays on different screen sizes), or functionality.
            </TextBlock>
            <TextBlock>
            I’m also happy to create full-blown web apps from the ground up and deploy them to a fast, reliable and cost-effective host.

            <TextBlock>
            Your happiness matters. All work is guaranteed and the job isn't finished until you are satsified.
