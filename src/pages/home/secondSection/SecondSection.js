            <StyledH1>Why hire Thomas P Chant Web Developer?</StyledH1>
            <TextBlock>
            I’ve been building websites as a hobby or professionally for almost 20 years using HTML, CSS, WordPress, JavaScript, React, and Next.js.             </TextBlock>
            <TextBlock>
            I’ve helped many organisations and companies reach wider audiences and increase visitor interaction. My clients have included <i>The Devon and Exeter Institution</i>,  <i>Exeter Historic Buildings Trust</i> and  <i>Exeter English Online</i>. 
            </TextBlock>
            <TextBlock>
            Alongside my web development skills, I have a Masters’ Degree in Creative Writing and am an experienced content creator both online and offline. 
            </TextBlock>
            <TextBlock>
            No job is too small. I’m happy to trouble-shoot and resolve minor issues with design, responsiveness (how a website displays on different screen sizes and devices), or functionality.            </TextBlock>
            <TextBlock>
            No job is too big. I’m also happy to create full-blown web apps from the ground up and deploy them to a fast, reliable, and cost-effective host.  
            </TextBlock>
            <TextBlock>
            Your happiness matters to me. All work is guaranteed, and the job isn't finished until you are 100% satisfied. 
            </TextBlock>
